Pobliski obiekt nie jest „przyciągany” siłą — po prostu podąża najprostszą możliwą drogą w tej zakrzywionej przestrzeni, wtaczając się w studnię. Newton nie jest jednak w błędzie: jego prawo to dokładnie to, czym staje się teoria Einsteina, gdy grawitacja jest słaba, a prędkości dużo mniejsze od prędkości światła — te same spadające orbity, które widziałeś, lecz z głębszym wyjaśnieniem.',

Ta drobna różnica przez dziesięciolecia pozostawała niewyjaśniona — aż ogólna teoria względności przewidziała dokładnie 43″. Zakrzywiona czasoprzestrzeń Słońca obraca orbitę.
